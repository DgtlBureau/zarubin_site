  - Security issues (API keys in frontend)
  - No tests, no documentation
- Code review findings (detailed):
  - 3,000 lines of code
  - 2,800 of it boilerplate
  - "AI" was literally: `fetch('https://api.openai.com')`
  - Cost to run: $2K/month in OpenAI fees (unsustainable)
- Our breaking point: Production load test
  - System crashed with 50 concurrent users
  - Response times 30+ seconds
  - Accuracy still 25%

- Cost savings: $2.1M annually
- Productivity: Higher than before
- This isn't about Poland, it's about the future
- Thesis: AI changes outsourcing economics fundamentally

**Section 1: The Nearshore Era (2020-2023) (400 words)**
- Why Poland in 2020:
  - Talent pool: 430K developers
  - Cost: $35-45/hour vs $80-120/hour US
  - Time zone: CET, 6-hour overlap with US East Coast

  - Output: Solid, predictable
  - Challenges: Communication overhead, some turnover
- ROI calculation then:
  - vs US team: Saved ~$2M/year
  - vs Asian offshore: Better quality, easier management
  - Sweet spot for many companies

**Section 2: The AI Inflection Point (2024) (500 words)**
- Q1 2024: Experimenting with AI tools
- Key realization: AI best at junior/mid-level tasks
- Data from our own tests:
  - Junior dev tasks: 80% can be AI-assisted
  - Mid-level tasks: 60% can be AI-assisted
  - Senior tasks: 30% can be AI-assisted (but 30% faster)
- Economic comparison (per year):
  - 10 junior devs (Poland): $800K
  - AI tools for same output: $60K (Copilot, Claude, GPT)
  - Savings: $740K on junior-level work
- The math gets brutal:
  - 45 devs × $71K avg = $3.2M
  - 15 senior devs × $95K + $100K AI tools = $1.5M
  - Savings: $1.7M/year
- But would it work?

**Section 3: The Transition (6 months) (500 words)**
- April-September 2024: Test phase
- Pilot program:
  - 10 developers + full AI toolkit
  - Same backlog as 25-person team
  - Measure: velocity, quality, morale
- Results after 3 months:
  - Velocity: 95% of 25-person team
  - Quality: Bugs down 10% (better tests via AI)
  - Morale: Mixed (some loved it, some hated "babysitting AI")
- Decision point: Scale or abandon?
- Financial reality won
- September 2024: Announced office closure
- The human element:
  - Offered relocation: 8 accepted (senior devs)
  - Severance package: 3 months + job placement help
  - Kept 7 as contractors for 6 months (transition)
- Emotional weight: This was hard
- But: Company survival required it

**Section 4: The New Model (Current) (450 words)**
- January 2025: New structure

  - 15 senior engineers (8 in US, 5 Poland remote, 2 contractors)
  - Avg salary: $95K (higher than before)
  - AI tool suite: $100K/year
  - Total: $1.525M vs $3.2M before
- How it works:
  - AI generates first draft code
  - Seniors review, refine, architect
  - Focus on: System design, integration, optimization
  - Junior work: Automated or AI-generated
- Productivity metrics (vs old 45-person team):
  - Features shipped: 115% (more, not less)
  - Time to market: 25% faster
  - Bug rate: 15% lower
  - Technical debt: Decreasing (seniors focus on quality)
- The secret sauce:
  - Hired for AI orchestration skills
  - Weekly training on new tools
  - Culture: Embrace AI, don't fight it
  - Metrics-driven: Track AI contribution

**Section 5: Economics Deep Dive (400 words)**
- Cost comparison table:
  - 2023 (45 Poland devs): $3.2M
  - 2025 (15 seniors + AI): $1.525M
  - Savings: $1.675M annually (52%)
- But wait, productivity:
  - Output: 115% of original team
  - Cost per feature: Down 58%
  - Quality: Improved
- The compounding effect:
  - AI tools improving monthly
  - Senior devs getting better at orchestration
  - Expect another 20% productivity gain in 2025
- When this doesn't work:
  - If you need warm bodies for clients (staff aug)
  - If AI tools banned (regulated industries)
  - If team lacks senior talent to orchestrate
  - If work is truly novel (research-level)

**Section 6: Industry Implications (350 words)**
- Our story isn't unique
- Data from surveys:
  - 37% of companies reducing nearshore in 2024-25
  - 68% increasing AI tool budgets
  - Nearshore/offshore market: Declining growth
- Geographic impact:
  - Poland: IT outsourcing growth slowing
  - India: Shifting from body-shop to AI specialists
  - Ukraine: War + AI = double pressure
  - LatAm: Nearshore advantage shrinking
- What survives:
  - High-end consulting (senior expertise)
  - Specialized domains (AI/ML, blockchain)
  - Staff augmentation for scale
  - Compliance/regulated work
- What dies:
  - Junior developer outsourcing
  - Generic CRUD development
  - Code monkey farms

**Conclusion (250 words)**
- 2020: Nearshore was the smart move
- 2025: AI + small senior team is smarter
- 2026: This will be the norm, not exception
- For Poland and others: Pivot up-market or perish
- For companies: The window is now
- Our advice:
  - Start experimenting with AI tools today
  - Don't cut staff yet, but don't backfill attrition
  - Train existing team on AI orchestration
  - Shift hiring: Senior only, AI-savvy
- The future: Smaller, senior, AI-augmented teams
