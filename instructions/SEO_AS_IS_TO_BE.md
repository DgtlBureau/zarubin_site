# SEO Strategy: AS IS → TO BE

## Executive Summary

This document provides honest analysis of current SEO state and proposes changes focused on:
- **Regulatory AI / Legal Tech** (main differentiator)
- **AI Development** (RAG, LLM, Agents, Fine-tuning)
- **Enterprise Consulting** (CRM, API, Integrations, ERP)

Key principle: **Only tag AI where AI actually exists.**

# PART 1: AS IS ANALYSIS

## 1.1 Cases - Current State

### Real AI Usage (Verified by Instruments)

| Case | Claude? | ML? | Real AI Work? | Honest Assessment |
|------|---------|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| **PersoniWay** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ YES | RAG, vector DB, AI chat assistant - REAL AI |
| **OAZIS** | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Claude in stack but content shows CRM/mobile |
| **Torpedo** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Claude+ML listed but content is CRM/mobile |
| **Grid Capital** | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ML listed, "predictive analytics" mentioned |
| **Jedipay** | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ML listed, "fraud detection" mentioned |
| **FCDM** | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ML listed but scope is e-commerce website |
| **Stocks Soccer** | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ML listed, "player valuation" mentioned |
| **T-Bank** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ NO | ML listed but scope is Tilda website |
| **Avangard** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ NO | No AI in instruments, just CRM/mobile |
| **Nashe Zoloto** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ NO | No AI, just Flutter mobile app |
| **Kama** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ NO | No AI, just Unity showroom |
| **NIS** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ NO | Process consulting, no AI |
| **TV-Start** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ NO | Streaming platform, no AI |
| **Lux Today** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ NO | MVP web development |
| **Norilsk** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ NO | Sports website, no AI |

### Current Title Problems

Almost all cases have "AI-" prefix but only 1 truly demonstrates AI:

```
❌ "AI-Enhanced Automotive Showroom Experience" - No AI, just Unity
❌ "AI-Enhanced Fan Engagement Platform" - No AI, just CRM
❌ "AI-Enhanced Fashion E-Commerce App" - No AI, just Flutter
❌ "AI-Driven Investment Platform Architecture" - Consulting only
❌ "AI Audit & Process Automation" - Process consulting
✅ "AI-Powered Field Service & Ticketing" - REAL: RAG + Claude
⚠️ "AI-Powered Digital Ecosystem for Fan Engagement" - Claude listed but not described
⚠️ "AI-Driven Workforce Management" - Claude listed but not described
```

### Current Industries Tags

```
Total unique tags: 14
- AI & Data Science (11 cases) ← Overused
- Sports (8 cases)
- Web development (7 cases)
- Mobile development (7 cases)
- CRM (4 cases)
- API Development (3 cases)
- FinTech (2 cases)
- IT Consulting (4 cases)
- OpsTech (2 cases)
- API Integrations (1 case)
- HVAC (1 case)
- SmartTV (1 case)
- Automotive (1 case)
- Retail (1 case)
- Service (1 case)
- Hospitality (1 case)
```

**Problem:** "AI & Data Science" on 11/15 cases but only 1-3 have real AI.

## 1.2 Main Page - Current State

### Current Metadata
```typescript
title: 'The BrightByte – Sport development and Custom software consulting | Raleigh, NC'
description: 'The BrightByte is an independent studio focused on building modern digital products...'
keywords: [
  'Product Studio',
  'Startup investment',
  'Sport software',        // ← Main focus
  'Custom Software Advisory',
  'Technology Consulting',
  'Startup Support',
  'Digital Product Design',
  'The BrightByte',
]
```

### Problems
1. **No AI keywords** despite having AI capabilities
2. **"Sport software"** as primary focus limits perception
3. **No regulatory/compliance keywords** despite Regfo expertise
4. **No LLM/RAG/Agent keywords** despite PersoniWay work
5. **Generic descriptions** that don't differentiate

# Summary

|--------|-------|-------|
| Cases with "AI" tag | 11/15 (73%) | 2-3/15 (15-20%) |
| AI keywords in main page | 0 | 10+ |
| Honest AI representation | ❌ Inflated | ✅ Accurate |
| Primary focus | Sport software | AI & Regulatory Tech |

**Key Message:** Stop claiming AI everywhere. Double down on where you actually have it (PersoniWay, Regfo expertise) and make that your differentiator.
