## About the Project

Like any leading football club, the goal of FCDM is to attract not only fans but also sponsors. To attract sponsors, it's essential to create product lines that harmonize with both the main brand of the football club "Dynamo" and potential partners interested in collaborating.

## Problem

The FCDM online store faced several issues related to outdated website design, leading to low conversion rates and loss of potential customers. These issues became decisive factors in deciding to redesign the website.

## Scope of Work

- Design and development of UX/UI for the football club's online presence.
- The work included:

  - Gathering visual references to convey the desired mood and style.
  - Creating basic layout mockups of pages without detailed design to establish structure and element placement.
  - Studying websites of other sports clubs and brands to understand trends.
  - Identifying strengths, weaknesses, successful solutions, and mistakes of competitors.
  - Main Page: Developing the primary design featuring key elements such as promotional banners, new arrivals, popular products, and promotions.
  - Product Categories: Designing category and subcategory pages with convenient filters and sorting options.
  - Product Details Page: Crafting designs for pages displaying detailed product information including photos, descriptions, sizes, color options, and prices.
  - Cart and Checkout Process: Designing the shopping cart, checkout pages, order confirmation, and payment pages.
  - Ensuring the store displays correctly across various devices (mobile phones, tablets, computers).

  This comprehensive approach aimed to enhance user experience, increase engagement, and improve conversion rates by modernizing the website's design and functionality to meet contemporary standards and user expectations in the sports retail sector.
