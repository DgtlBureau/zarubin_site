## About the Project

We have tournament and player screens. The system retrieves data from TransferMarket, which stores information about player values and portfolios, and displays it on the front end. Users are required to build player portfolios and compete against each other based on these portfolios. After assembling a portfolio, users can make substitutions on each match day, thereby changing the value of their portfolio.

## Problem

One of the key challenges for sports clubs is low fan engagement. Fans are divided into several levels of engagement:

- Newcomers
- Casual TV viewers
- Stadium attendees
- Loyalty program participants

Clubs struggle because fans at the latter two levels rarely engage in referral programs or actively involve their friends.

## Scope of Work

- Creation of a fan engagement system similar to fantasy sports, incorporating a referral program for sports clubs and a white-label model to increase fan engagement beyond current levels.
- Designed and developed a clickable prototype in Figma.
- Developed backend and multiple versions of a pilot web application.
- The system itself was conceptualized as a white-label implementation of specific engagement mechanics, featuring:
  - Quizzes
  - Competitions between players
  - Onboarding processes

This approach aimed to enhance fan interaction and retention through interactive and competitive elements tailored to sports club environments.
