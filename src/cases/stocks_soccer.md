## About

Web-based fantasy sports startup allowing users to trade
virtual shares of soccer players based on real-time
performance data.

## Problem

One of the key challenges for sports clubs is low fan engagement. Fans are divided into several levels of engagement:

- Newcomers
- Casual TV viewers
- Stadium attendees
- Loyalty program participants

Clubs struggle because fans at the latter two levels rarely engage in referral programs or actively involve their friends.

## Scope of Work

- Creation of a <strong>fan engagement system</strong> similar to fantasy sports, incorporating a referral program for sports clubs and a white-label model to increase fan engagement beyond current levels.
- Designed and developed a <strong>clickable prototype</strong> in Figma.
- Developed backend and multiple versions of a <strong>pilot web application</strong>.

<p>The system itself was conceptualized as a white-label implementation of specific engagement mechanics, featuring:</p>

- Quizzes
- Competitions between players
- Onboarding processes

<p>This approach aimed to enhance fan interaction and retention through interactive and competitive elements tailored to sports club environments.</p>
