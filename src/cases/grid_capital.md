## Problem

Grid Capital faced an issue where the previous team had been working on development for over six months without delivering a final product. The client needed to reconstruct the project's progress, establish clear business processes, and steer the project back on track.

## Scope of Work

- IT audit
- Audit of business processes
- The work included a brief overview of activities concerning back-end, front-end, backlog creation, etc.

<p>
The audit was based on completed and pending tasks in the backlog. As part of the solution:
</p>

- A technical director was identified for the company
- Current repositories with the latest working version were restored
- A task list was compiled to bring the project to completion
- Within the allocated budget, a small development team was assembled to finalize the project
