## About

The key IT system, within which the business process was to be built, was called "On Our Way." As part of the loyalty program, users stop at a gas station, order food, and receive cashback on their card.

## Problem

The lack of business processes led to the company missing deadlines, experiencing employee turnover due to unmet tasks, and a lack of transparency in business processes.There was insufficient user awareness, a lack of notifications about upcoming matches, no internal team comments, no announcements of club events, etc.

## Scope of Work

- Conducted a series of interviews to identify the root cause of the absence of business processes
- Compiled the current task portfolio
- Determined which areas of responsibility were being fulfilled and which were not
- Identified at which stages systemic problems were arising
- Investigated why the final IT solution was not being delivered on time

<p>
As part of the solution, we conducted research and created a list of business processes. Within these business processes, we developed a matrix of employees with specific business task responsibilities. We designed the business process for developing the IT system for mobile applications and implemented task flow management systems (Scrum, Kanban).

## Business Process Management

To accumulate points, multiple IT systems need to be integrated. For these systems to be integrated, a streamlined process of team and inter-team interaction is necessary. We delved into the company's internal development, identified existing positions (Front-end, Back-end, Mobile, project management structure), and built the organization from scratch, providing IT audit services.
