## About

We organized the development process and launched a website for a startup focused on emigration. It was crucial to launch the portal in the shortest possible time. We managed to complete all the work and launch the portal in just 4 weeks.

## Main Goals

1. **Requirements Gathering & Planning**
   <br/>
   Collaborating with the client to identify the core features and functionalities for the portal, prioritizing those needed for the MVP (minimum viable product) within a limited time frame.

2. **UI/UX Design**  
   Creating user-friendly designs that cater to the target audience (people looking to emigrate) with a focus on intuitive navigation and quick access to relevant information.

3. **Back-end & Front-end Development**  
   Implementing the back-end infrastructure to handle data, user registrations, and content management while developing a responsive front-end for a seamless user experience across devices.

4. **Third-party Integrations**  
   Integrating essential services, such as immigration resources, news feeds, and possibly visa processing tools or databases for up-to-date information.

5. **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
   Ensuring the portal functions smoothly by conducting comprehensive testingâ€”covering performance, security, and usability before the official launch.

6. **Deployment & Support**  
   Successfully launching the portal on a stable hosting platform, setting up continuous monitoring, and providing post-launch support to ensure smooth operations and future updates.
