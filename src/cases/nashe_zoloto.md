## Problem

An overwhelming shift of e-commerce into online platforms has eliminated offline boutiques entirely. Therefore, personalized customer engagement has become crucial. Many fashion market players strive to stand out amidst the competition. Methods employed include:

- AI assistants that visualize products on customers without physical fitting (shoes, rings, etc.),
- mobile applications
- 3D AR assistants.

## Scope of Work

Development of a mobile application for e-commerce in the fashion industry style. Our client "Nash–µ Zoloto" manufactures over 5000 accessories and jewelry items. The project included:

- Prototyping (FigJam)
- UX/UI design (Figma)
- Mobile application development on Flutter

## Mobile Application

The <strong>mobile app</strong> utilizes over 80 screens in various states, focusing on Customer Journey Mapping <strong>(CJM)</strong>. It starts with customers not needing to log in; they simply create a list of items and can place an order without prepayment. A manager directly contacts the customer to confirm the order, with payment processed automatically via a payment link code.
