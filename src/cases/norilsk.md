- Prototyping of screens, including: Home, Matches, Calendar, Standings, News, and Shop pages
- Creation of <strong>UX/UI design</strong>
- Preparation of layouts
- CMS setup
- <strong>Preparation of monthly content:</strong> information about coaches, players, transfers, major announcements, and match comments. Content upload to the website.
