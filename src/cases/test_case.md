## About the Project

The hockey club has a large vertical structure, starting with a children's academy, youth team, women's team, senior team, and a team from the Continental Hockey League. Within this vertical, the hockey club has a large number of websites. It is recommended to develop these sites to be on a single platform. Additionally, this includes ticket sales and merchandise both online and offline. To ensure that a customer coming to the stadium can buy a scarf, receive tickets, and gain loyalty program bonuses, a close integration between all these systems is necessary.
