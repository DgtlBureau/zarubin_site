## Problem

The release of new cars always involves numerous UX/UI and A/B tests. Consequently, to conduct these tests, it is necessary to create a car simulator through which testers can verify various hypotheses. Without such a device, it is difficult to understand how the user will ultimately behave behind the wheel

## Scope of Work

- Development of a test stand on which tests, UX/UI solutions, and hypotheses are verified.
- Creation of tablet applications for iPad and Android, which are mounted on the steering wheel and used to conduct various tests, such as:
  - Changing the display when turning the steering wheel
- Development of an interface that allows changing colors, fonts, and UX/UI elements during testing, adjusting screen backlight with changes in daylight, etc.
- Creation of several key elements of the multimedia entertainment system:
  - Development of a media player
  - Development of navigation maps
  - Development of an instrument panel
  - Interface elements for launching third-party applications within the system
