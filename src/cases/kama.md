## Problem

The release of new cars always involves numerous UX/UI and A/B tests. Consequently, to conduct these tests, it is necessary to create a car simulator through which testers can verify various hypotheses. Without such a device, it is difficult to understand how the user will ultimately behave behind the wheel

## Scope of Work

<p>
<strong>Development of a test stand</strong> on which tests, <strong>UX/UI solutions</strong>, and hypotheses are verified.
Creation of <strong>tablet applications</strong> for iPad and Android, which are mounted on the steering wheel and used to conduct various tests, such as:
</p>

- Changing the display when turning the steering wheel
- Development of an interface that allows changing colors, fonts, and UX/UI elements during testing, adjusting screen backlight with changes in daylight, etc.

  <br/>Creation of several key elements of the multimedia entertainment system:

- Development of a media player
- Development of navigation maps
- Development of an instrument panel
- Interface elements for launching third-party applications within the system
