## About

PersoniWay is an AI-powered support platform designed specifically for field technicians in industries like HVAC, electrical, and equipment servicing. The product consists of a smart assistant chatbot, a ticketing and knowledge system, and an admin dashboard for service company managers. Its goal is to streamline troubleshooting, reduce time on site, and standardize support workflows through intelligent automation.

## Problem

Technicians often face issues while on-site without access to relevant documentation or real-time support. The client needed a system that could help specialists resolve issues faster, avoid repetitive calls to dispatch, and digitize tribal knowledge within the organization. Managers, in turn, needed visibility into request patterns and tools to improve service quality.

## Scope of Work

<p><strong>AI Chat Assistant</strong> is the core of the system, trained on technical documentation, diagrams, and previous tickets. It helps technicians on-site to:</p>

- troubleshoot equipment issues based on symptoms,
- auto-categorize the problem and initiate a support ticket,
- retrieve wiring diagrams, manuals, and part numbers instantly,
- log and voice-record incidents with minimal effort.

<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Ticketing System</strong> enables dispatchers and support teams to:</p>

- monitor technician requests in real-time,
- assign specialists or escalate issues to supervisors,
- attach internal notes, files, and responses,
- analyze incident types and technician performance across regions.

<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Admin Dashboard</strong> provides managers with operational insights. They can:</p>

<br>

- upload and manage the knowledge base and documentation,
- configure AI prompts and data sources,
- track resolution times, team workloads, and failure patterns,
- export analytics and reports for quality assurance.

<br>
<br>
 
<p>The system supports mobile-first use, voice-to-text input, and multi-device syncing, ensuring field readiness. Itâ€™s built on top of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture and uses vector databases to query technical information rapidly and contextually.</p>
