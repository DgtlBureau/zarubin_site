## About the Project

Luxtoday was founded in 2021 in Luxembourg by Daniil Kirikov and launched as a platform to publish news, current events and activities, as well as "how to live" in the Grand Duchy. Our goal was to simplify integration for both new and current residents. Today, we have transformed and continue to evolve every day, but our values and commitment remain unchanged.

## Problem

The primary challenge that LuxToday aims to address is the overwhelming process that immigrants and relocates face when moving to Luxembourg. The lack of centralized and accessible information about legal requirements, local services, and life in Luxembourg can make the transition daunting and stressful. People often struggle with obtaining the right information on residency permits, work licenses, and integration into the local community.

## Scope of Work

The LuxToday platform was meticulously developed using WordPress coupled with Next.js for enhanced static typing and fast page loading times, ensuring a smooth user experience. The scope of work included:

- Content Development:
- Creating comprehensive, easy-to-understand content that guides users through the migration process, document acquisition, and integration into Luxembourg's social and cultural scenes.

- Platform Design and Development:
- Implementing a user-friendly design that allows easy navigation and access to information.
- The site's architecture was designed to ensure reliability and speed, accommodating a high volume of users without compromising performance.

- Partnership Coordination:
- Working closely with Luxembourg government agencies to ensure that all provided information is accurate, up-to-date, and useful for incoming residents.

- User Experience Optimization:
- Utilizing advanced web technologies to enhance the interactive experience and provide quick access to the most sought-after information.
