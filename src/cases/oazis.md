## About

The goal of the project was to integrate all social services for shift workers into a mobile application. Additionally, it aimed to provide management capabilities for services at the management site. Consequently, the project was divided into two parts: a mobile application for shift workers and the development of an administrative panel for management site employees.

## Problem

The client had an idea but didn't know how to bring it to life. We conducted research and proposed various development scenarios.

## Scope of Work

<p><strong>A White Labelfunctionality</strong> system for asset management was created. Within the scope of the asset, the user has access to managing dining facilities, accommodation facilities, notifications, announcements, etc.</p>

<p>This system is intended for administrators who create accounts for employees of companies purchasing the <strong>CMS system</strong>. Using the CMS, the administrator can track the number of people scheduled to arrive, the number of people expected to go on business trips, monitor feedback form statistics, track the progress and status of requests, and more.</p>

<p>The <strong>mobile application</strong> is adapted for end users. These are active employees who are going on business trips. Their problem was that, in the absence of an information system, it was extremely difficult for them to request changes to any applications during their business trips. With the mobile application, they now have the ability to:</p>

- request repairs,
- order meals for the next day,
- request additional information about the business trip or location from their supervisor,
- access the wifi system, media services, and more.
