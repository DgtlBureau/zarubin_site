## About

The hockey club has a large vertical structure, starting with a children's academy, youth team, women's team, senior team, and a team from the Continental Hockey League. Within this vertical, the hockey club has a large number of websites. It is recommended to develop these sites to be on a single platform. Additionally, this includes ticket sales and merchandise both online and offline. To ensure that a customer coming to the stadium can buy a scarf, receive tickets, and gain loyalty program bonuses, a close integration between all these systems is necessary.

## Problem

The lack of a loyalty program. Insufficient user awareness, lack of notifications about upcoming matches, no internal team comments, no announcements of club events, etc.

## Scope of Work

- Development of a <strong>loyalty program</strong>
- Creation of rules for accruing bonus points
- Issuance and redemption of coupons for bonus points
- Creation of <strong>CRM system</strong> requirements to store user data
- Development of a unified authorization system (personal account)
- Development of a <strong>mobile application</strong>
- Creation of a unified web platform that implements the personal account and loyalty program
