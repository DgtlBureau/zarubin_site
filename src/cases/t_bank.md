## About the Project

- Increase the popularity of street football: provide an attractive and convenient space for engaging with active participants and spectators.
- Attract new clients for T-Bank: create opportunities to integrate the bank's services with the project, offering exclusive deals and events for users.

## Main Goals

The lack of a loyalty program. Insufficient user awareness, lack of notifications about upcoming matches, no internal team comments, no announcements of club events, etc.

## Scope of Work

- Develop a website on the Tilda platform
- Integrate with a ticketing system
- Pull promo codes directly from Google Sheets
- Implement user registration mechanics for matches and events
- Register T-BANK clients for the draft
