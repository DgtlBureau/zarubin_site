The responsibilities of Project Managers and Product Managers are often confused. Let's clarify once and for all who is who, how they work, and where they intersect.

## Project Manager

A Project Manager's work focuses on organizing the team and ensuring an even workload for its members. The Project Manager is responsible for planning and following the business strategy. They coordinate actions with stakeholders in different teams, remove barriers, help reach key milestones, and continuously monitor progress. They also handle budgeting, planning, and resource allocation for the project as a whole.

Essentially, a Project Manager deals with administration, answering questions like: What kind of team are we? How much does it cost and how long will the project last? They use tools like Gantt charts, Kanban, Scrum, Agile methodologies, and knowledge bases like Wiki, YouTrack, etc. Project administration follows the chosen methodology within the set project deadline.

## Product Manager

A Product Manager is responsible for market research and understanding the target audience's needs, forming the product concept, and planning the sequence of feature launches for commercial use. They control the problem-solving space: gathering requirements, building the product vision and strategy, creating a roadmap, and prioritizing features.

Business owners involve them to monitor the cost per lead and acquisition expenses. For example, if the task is to create a website for 1 million. The KPI for a Product Manager is to launch on time and within budget. The Product Manager can spend even 2 million and miss the deadline—what matters is the result, as money will be gradually spent on testing hypotheses. The main focus here is the business model's profitability. The allocated funds must pay off for the result to be considered successful. Therefore, a Product Manager focuses on team management, while a Project Manager focuses on business scaling issues.

## How Do They Coexist?

During project implementation, it's crucial to ensure that the Project Manager and Product Manager align on three points: product vision and strategy, release planning, and product architecture.

### Product Vision and Strategy

Without these artifacts, achieving a cohesive result is impossible. Developers and other team members need them to avoid aimless sprint-to-sprint work without a clear goal.

The Product Manager sets the product vision and strategy, but if the Project Manager does not share the main goal and path of the project, it can lead to negative consequences. Understanding the strategy helps eliminate potential blocks, track progress, and quickly adapt to market, competitor, and technology changes.

### Release Planning

Another stage where ineffective communication can jeopardize the project's success. Collaboration is crucial here—the Product Manager works on details with their team, while the Project Manager provides information about program capabilities and nuances. Final sprints are a good time to connect with the Product Manager and weigh priority changes. In Agile, there's always a flexible system to make quick adjustments.

### Product Architecture

Changes in product architecture not accounted for in planning can lead to barriers or delays. For example, in the third year of working on a program, the business decided to switch to a cloud system. This means transitioning the product from a monolithic to a microservice architecture—a costly and time-consuming idea. Obtaining information about the product architecture at the project's start allows the Project Manager to assess risks more accurately and reduce the likelihood of missing deadlines and budget overruns.

While the Project Manager focuses on how and when the product is created, the Product Manager's competence lies in what and why. Both roles directly impact the creation of market-successful products. Therefore, effective communication between these specialists is essential. They share similarities, but keep in mind that the Project Manager will typically be more of an executor, while the Product Manager is the visionary. Their fundamentally different approaches can work together as a powerful, effective mechanism. So, don't hold back on sharing knowledge and remember that the success of one manager on a project depends on the success of the other.
