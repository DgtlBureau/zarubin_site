We have all encountered job titles like "Software Engineers," "Category V Specialists," and other engineering-specific titles. Many developers wonder why a position listed as an iOS developer on hh.ru suddenly changes its title upon employment. There are several reasons for this, and to understand them, we need to explore how these positions come to be.

Such titles are most commonly found in government corporations and large businesses with over 500 employees. These organizations have a grading system that determines salaries. Without such a system, motivation would depend on individual preferences, which is given very little importance. Due to the specific nature of these companies, engineering positions are already established.

For example, there might be a second-class engineer at an oil refinery (OR), responsible for changing mechanisms. Suppose the company needs to create a position for a Python developer. This causes confusion because salary levels and responsibilities are already set—for instance, an engineer might earn 100,000 rubles at the second grade. Naturally, in a competitive environment, it's hard to attract people with such constraints.

This creates a dilemma—whether to change processes or look for people. Changing the process can take up to six months. Companies manage this by hiring people through a subsidiary legal entity, where the grades are the same but the salary levels differ. Another option is to create positions and "lend" people to another legal entity. This effectively forms a subcontracting model, where a subsidiary company organically develops to serve the needs of the main company.

The result is that the person is hired, but the processes are not adapted. There is a lack of adaptation, HR branding, and other issues. Eventually, large businesses decide to undergo digital transformation, but this takes time and often requires the accumulation of several other problems. Meanwhile, a middle Python developer remains a second-class engineer.

This highlights the importance of understanding the organizational structure and the complexities of job titles in large corporations. Despite the challenges, adapting to these structures is essential for professional growth and ensuring that developers are adequately recognized and compensated for their skills.
