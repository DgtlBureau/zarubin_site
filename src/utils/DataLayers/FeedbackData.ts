      'We hired BrightByte to build PersoniWay — an AI-based assistant for field technicians. I was impressed with how quickly they understood our domain and got things moving. The scope was clear, the execution fast, and my own involvement minimal. They operated independently, asked smart questions when needed, and delivered consistently — without bloated timelines or inflated budgets. It is rare to find a team thats both technically sharp and business-savvy. Highly recommend if you need traction without friction.',

      'We are working with BrightByte on a sports publication website with a relatively simple tech stack that involves integrations. Previous developers consistently delivered an incomplete product full of bugs and were unresponsive when issues were pointed out. BrightByte team has shown a high level of professionalism, adhering to a clear business process and a systematic approach at every stage. I highly recommend working with them.',
