      "We are working with BrightByte on a sports publication website with a relatively simple tech stack that involves integrations. Previous developers consistently delivered an incomplete product full of bugs and were unresponsive when issues were pointed out. Vitaliy's team has shown a high level of professionalism, adhering to a clear business process and a systematic approach at every stage. I highly recommend working with them.",
