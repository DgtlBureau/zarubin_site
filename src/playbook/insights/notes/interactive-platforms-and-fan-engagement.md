Each year, the role of digital products in the sports sector becomes increasingly significant, offering new opportunities for athletes, managers, and fans alike. In our best practices checklist for improving key metrics of sports clubs, we focus on analyzing tools for better website and app performance.

**The Digital Technologies Bureau has identified the TOP-15 product features to enhance the core metrics of a sports brand.**

The digitalization of sports opens up a wide range of possibilities, including process automation, enhanced communication, personalization, increased club loyalty, and the attraction of new fans through interactive and engaging platforms. These innovations can increase efficiency, deliver joy and satisfaction to both professional athletes and enthusiasts, deepen interaction between clubs and their fans, and open up new prospects for business development in sports organizations.

We analyzed the key goals of sports clubs, paid attention to fans' interests, and presented innovative solutions to attract attention to the club and its activities. While creating the checklist, we delved into process automation in sports club management, cross-selling, loyalty programs, and other modern methods of audience engagement and involvement.

_"Identifying strategies that can enhance the attractiveness of sports clubs."_

The goal of this research is to provide a clear overview and analysis of the potential of digital products in sports, as well as to identify strategies that can enhance the attractiveness of sports clubs and ensure their successful development. Let's break it down step by step.

## 10 Goals Every Club Pursues

Before starting work on the project, we needed to understand the common goals pursued by every sports club and determine where to focus our attention. We formulated 10 general goals for clubs:

1. Increasing brand recognition and club image.
2. Attracting and retaining fans, forming an active fan community.
3. Boosting ticket, subscription, and merchandise sales.
4. Monetizing digital audience through subscriptions, donations.
5. Providing quality sports content for fans.
6. Identifying and developing sports talents.
7. Achieving high team sports results.
8. Promoting a healthy lifestyle and popularizing sports.
9. Ensuring financial stability and sustainable club development.
10. Creating a positive club and sports image in society.

Each of these points can be developed and digitized, implementing a coherent system into the website and app operations. ðŸŒŸ

## More About the Checklist

In the research conducted by the Digital Technologies Bureau (DTB), we focused on goals related to commerce, loyalty, and content. Previously, we discussed the primary objectives of clubs and explored the best practices of leaders in the sports market. Research plays a crucial role in identifying operational options and modern methods, providing information for the development and implementation of innovative digital solutions in the sports industry.

We propose a new approach to seat selection at the stadium, with the ability to view an overview using a 3D model.

The option to transfer tickets to a friend or relative is convenient for those who are hesitant to buy tickets in advance for matches or in case of force majeure situations. The sports club not only increases loyalty but also gains the ability to forecast stadium capacity in advance.

Targeted donations are an opportunity to do a good deed and justify the price of a match. A loyal fan rarely refuses the chance to support their favorite club, but sometimes attends matches as an alternative to having a fun time or diversifying family leisure.

We offer ideas on how to improve cross-selling.

During matches, additional sales can and should be made. Moreover, fans will be interested in the option of home or office delivery of tickets and merchandise. For the sports club, this translates to increasing the average check, at the very least.

Regarding content, clubs need to actively engage fans in club life outside of matches through the "Mobile-first" principle: quick stories and highlights.

If the club does not yet have a loyalty program, now is the time to implement one. The Bureau provides ideas that are easy to implement.

And other operational options that will help promote and increase loyalty to the sports club. The research by the Digital Technologies Bureau is literally for everyone, from fans to sponsors. Understanding what drives a sports club and how to improve not only game results but also content performance is crucial.

### Key Points and Conclusions

Let's approach the question from another angle: what is needed for the website to work, and for developers' efforts to bear fruit.

Firstly, the key factor of success is personalizing content and offers for fans. By using user preference data, it's possible to segment the audience and offer relevant content. This increases loyalty and engagement.

Secondly, it's essential to optimize UX/UI design of the website and app. Easy navigation and a user-friendly interface contribute to conversions into desired actionsâ€”ticket purchases, service subscriptions, store usage.

Thirdly, mobile development must be prioritized, as mobile traffic is growing the fastest. The app should be lightweight and intuitive.

Fourthly, actively utilize gamification and interactive contentâ€”polls, quizzes, contests. This stimulates user engagement.

Fifthly, cross-selling and loyalty programs. Additional services, goods, or features that will interest fans, along with creating a loyalty program to reward active participation and support of the club.

By implementing these recommendations, sports clubs can attract more fans, increase sales, create additional monetization sources, and take digital assets to a new level of efficiency. Sports awaken passion and loyalty, especially when fans actively participate in the team's life. The right combination of digital products in creating a crisis-resistant brand culture is the key to winning fans' loyalty. Evaluate your capabilities and find partners to address any gaps.
