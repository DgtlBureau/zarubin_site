Welcome to the world of custom development! Turning an idea into a product can be a lengthy and costly process. However, with the use of innovative approaches in development, it can become an exciting journey to success. We employ Agile methodologies, modern tools like YouTrack, and CI/CD setups on our servers.

At the Bright Byte, we apply contemporary innovative methods and tools in our development processes. Our company specializes in developing custom mobile applications, websites, and software. Our team of professionals uses cutting-edge technologies such as Flutter, AI, machine learning, containerization, and DevOps to help our clients achieve their goals.

In this article, we will explore the innovative approaches used in custom development and how their application can help achieve business success. Here, we will present 10 facts about custom software development that you may not know.

Custom software development is an integral part of various business sectors, enabling the creation of unique products that meet specific client needs. The main goal for businesses is to employ innovative approaches to speed up the process and reduce the costs of product creation.

## 1. Modern Tools in Custom Development Accelerate Product Creation and Reduce Costs

Modern software development methods significantly speed up the product creation process and reduce development costs. For instance, using the Agile methodology allows us to create products faster and more efficiently, reducing development time and project costs. In this regard, we use Scrum and Kanban boards in the YouTrack system.

### Flutter for Cross-Platform Development

Flutter, developed by Google and using the Dart programming language, is an open-source framework for creating cross-platform mobile and web applications. One of the main advantages of Flutter is that it allows developers to create applications that work on various platforms (Android, iOS, web) using the same codebase. This significantly reduces the time and costs associated with developing applications for different platforms, compared to native development.

The innovation of Flutter lies in its speed and efficiency. Flutter uses its own engine, which provides high application performance and fast graphics rendering. Thanks to this, applications created with Flutter run smoothly and quickly, which is critically important for user experience.

Another advantage of Flutter is its flexibility and ability to respond quickly to changes. This is achieved through the hot reload feature, allowing developers to see changes in real-time without restarting the application.

Moreover, Flutter has numerous ready-made widgets and tools for rapid interface development. This significantly speeds up the development process, as developers can use pre-made components instead of creating everything from scratch.

Overall, Flutter is an innovative approach to mobile and web application development, allowing for reduced development time and costs for applications on different platforms. Thanks to its speed, efficiency, flexibility, and ease of use, Flutter is becoming increasingly popular among developers and companies aiming to expedite their development process and deliver high-quality applications.

## 2. Agile Methodology

Agile and Scrum allow us to quickly respond to changes in product requirements and launch functional versions at early stages of development. This enables our clients to receive feedback from users faster and save time and resources on subsequent development iterations. For example, we applied Agile in the creation of a mobile application for online tour booking, which enabled us to quickly add new features to meet the client's demands.

## 3. AI to Enhance Our Processes

At the Bright Byte, we utilize AI and machine learning in custom mobile app development. These tools help us enhance efficiency and accuracy in various business domains such as finance, healthcare, transportation, and more. For example, we used machine learning to create a smart home management mobile app that automatically adapts to user habits and preferences.

## 4. Full Release Delivery Cycle with CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is another innovative approach we use in our work on mobile applications. This approach allows us to reduce the time between development and product launch, minimize risks, and improve quality. For instance, we used CI/CD in the development of an online education platform's mobile application, enabling us to quickly release updates and enhance the app's functionality.

## 5. Design Thinking Methodology

Design Thinking is a user-centric product development approach. It helps developers understand the needs and problems of clients on a deeper level and create products that solve real problems. This is achieved through an iterative design cycle that includes phases of user understanding, problem definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing. This approach allows developers to more accurately define tasks, reduce failure risks, and increase the likelihood of product success in the market.

## 6. Data Analysis and Research

Modern tools for data collection and analysis allow developers to quickly determine which product features are most popular with users. Various data collection and analysis methods are used for this, such as product usage monitoring, user surveys, and social media data analysis. This information helps developers better understand user needs and adapt the product to their requirements, enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing the chances of a successful product launch.

## 7. Container Virtualization

Container virtualization is a technology that allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged into containers, which can be deployed on any platform. This accelerates the development process and reduces the costs of deploying and managing applications.

According to research by Docker, using containers reduces application deployment time by up to 13 times and dependency installation time by up to 50 times. Additionally, containers make it easy to scale applications, allowing for quick responses to user growth.

## 8. Distributed Systems

Distributed systems consist of independent components working on different network nodes, interacting to perform a common task. This allows for the creation of applications that can scale horizontally and vertically while providing high fault tolerance.

According to Gartner, by the end of 2023, distributed systems will become the standard for developing large applications. They improve fault tolerance, ensure high availability, and reduce risks associated with hardware or software failures.

## 9. DevOps Enhances Development and Market Delivery Speed

DevOps is a methodology that integrates the processes of development and operations. This accelerates development, shortens release cycles, and increases the speed of responding to changes in product requirements.

Research by Puppet indicates that organizations using DevOps release new product versions 46% more frequently and experience 96% fewer errors in production environments.

## 10. Microservices and Monoliths

Microservices architecture involves developing an application as a set of small, independent components, each performing a specific function. These components can be developed and deployed independently, providing high flexibility and scalability. Microservices architecture can be used to create any type of application, from mobile apps to complex data management systems.

By using innovative approaches in development, clients can receive high-quality products in a shorter time frame and at a lower cost. Custom development at the Bright Byte offers many advantages over purchasing ready-made solutions. It allows for the creation of a unique product that precisely meets the needs of your business. Additionally, custom software development provides opportunities to save time and money, enhance product security, select the most suitable technologies, and achieve a tailored solution.
