On July 20, 2023, the 9th Women's World Football Championship kicked off. It's no secret that women's sports are on the path to a historic breakthrough. The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming pivotal in creating new opportunities and achieving grandiose results for women's sports. The use of AI opens up new perspectives and brings a breath of fresh air, ushering in change.

By the way, in July of last year, 2022, EA Sports FIFA introduced the ability to play as a women's team in the game. The Women's Super League of the Football Association in England, the Women's Football Championship in France became available. And on next-generation platforms, the dedicated motion capture technology HyperMotion2 ensures realistic player movements, characteristic of women's football. This is indeed a revolution, and in the near future, we believe there will be more interesting innovations for women and about women in sports.

## History of Women in Sports

Before delving into AI, let's recall the long journey women have taken to approach sports. For many centuries, women were not allowed to participate in sports due to socio-cultural and societal restrictions.

However, with the intensification of the fight for equal rights in the 19th-20th centuries, women actively advocated for the opportunity to engage in sports on par with men. In 1900, at the Paris Olympics, the first women's competitions were held, including golf and tennis.

Throughout the 20th century, women faced obstacles in accessing professional sports and often experienced discrimination. However, significant changes occurred in the 20th-21st centuries. Specialized women's sports leagues and organizations emerged, leading to the growing popularity and recognition of women's sports.

Over the past decades, women have made a significant contribution to sports achievements. They have become stars in disciplines such as tennis, figure skating, athletics, swimming, basketball, football, and many others.

Women's sports competitions like the Women's Nations League in football, the Women's National Basketball Association, among others, are gaining increasing recognition and interest from spectators.

**Fact**  
Nevertheless, a quick search on the internet for players with the most goals scored in international football will lead you to links where Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Sunil Chhetri are in the top 5. Although, in reality, there are 6 women with more international goals than CR7, who tops the men's list.

## The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Women's Sports

Female athletes are more often involved in the process of discrimination than male athletes. Moreover, studies have shown that women face violence three times more often than their male colleagues. Despite this, male athletes are the first to receive cutting-edge advancements.

It was precisely at FIFA-2023 that software was first used to detect attempts at harassment.

But is it worth dividing the importance of technology based on any criteria? We think not, and here's why Artificial Intelligence is needed in women's sports.

# Innovations in Data Analysis and Preparation ðŸš€

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in women's sports demonstrates its strengths in analyzing vast amounts of data. Tracking biometric indicators, training techniques, and physical preparation based on data analysis helps identify individual characteristics of each athlete. This allows coaches and medical specialists to develop more personalized training programs and enhance training effectiveness.

## Technologies in Virtual and Augmented Reality

With the use of AI, virtual and augmented reality become more accessible and engaging for female athletes. Excellent training simulators and innovative applications help improve movement techniques, develop reaction time, and contribute to more efficient preparation for real competitions.

## Talent Search and Development

AI also opens new horizons in talent discovery and development among girls and women. Machine learning algorithms help identify promising athletes based on their physical data, technical skills, and past achievements. This expands the talent pool and ensures fairer access to development opportunities in sports.

## Interactive Platforms and Audience Engagement

With AI, sports clubs and leagues can create interactive platforms and applications that provide unique content and engage fans. Technologies like holography, chatbots, and data analytics enable the creation of rich and immersive experiences for viewers, as well as bring fans closer to women's teams.

## Awareness and Equality Enhancement

AI plays a key role in raising awareness about women's sports and advocating for equality in the sports industry. Machine learning algorithms contribute to increasing visibility of women's teams, athletes, and achievements. This helps change stereotypes and promotes a more fair representation of women in the sports world.

## Path to the Future

The revolution in women's sports using Artificial Intelligence is just beginning. The implementation of new technologies and innovative solutions raises the bar for women's sports teams, making them more competitive and motivating them to achieve new heights.

It is important to note that the use of AI in women's sports also presents its challenges and requires ensuring transparency, ethics, and data protection. However, the correct use of artificial intelligence in women's sports can create a favorable and innovative environment for the development and improvement of women's sports achievements. AI can help develop inclusive and gender-neutral products.

### Interesting Fact

Nike recognized the importance of creating products for female athletes and recently launched football boots for women, Phantom Luna, described as the "most innovative and researched women's boots". They were a bit late to the party, but better late than never.

The first at this party was Laura Youngson, lady boss and inspiration of Ida Sports, who came up with the brilliant idea of creating football boots specifically designed for women back in 2018.

## In Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence is becoming an integral part of the development of women's sports, contributing to its prosperity and calling for greater participation and support. In the future, we will see more innovations that will forever change and make women's sports more impressive.

It is important to note that the use of AI in women's sports also presents its challenges and requires ensuring transparency, ethics, and data protection. However, the correct use of artificial intelligence in women's sports can create a favorable and innovative environment for the development and improvement of women's sports achievements. AI can help develop inclusive and gender-neutral products.
