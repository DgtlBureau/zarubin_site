# Organise retail food service with bespoke software solutions

At **Bright Byte**, we specialise in delivering bespoke digital solutions that help businesses streamline operations and improve the customer experience. One of our key clients, [**Oazis**](https://thebrightbyte.com/solutions/oazis), required a comprehensive system to manage **shift workers** and deliver essential services while they were at remote sites. Our expertise enabled us to develop a bespoke system that integrates **food ordering** and **meal planning** directly into their **shift management application**. This system not only increases efficiency but also improves the overall experience for remote workers.

## The Retail Shift Management System

Oazis is a company that provides **remote workforce management** for employees working on large industrial or isolated projects. These workers often face challenges in accessing meals and services. The **Oazis Shift Management System** is designed to solve this problem by providing a seamless way to manage:

- **location information**: Workers can track where they are assigned and access details about the location.
- **Technical requests**: Employees can easily create support or technical requests for issues in the field.
- Food services: Employees can order meals ahead of time, bypassing the canteen line, and even receive discounts on pre-ordered meals.

By integrating all of these functionalities into one app, the **Oazis System** increases efficiency and reduces the logistical challenges workers face during their shifts.

## Integration with local food service

One of the outstanding features of the **Shift Management System** is its integration with a **local food service system** that handles meal preparation, storage and payment processing. Our solution involved integrating this third party system into the existing infrastructure, allowing for seamless ordering and payment of meals.

### Key features of the integration:

- **Meal pre-order and payment**: Employees can pre-order their meals directly from the app, avoiding long queues and ensuring their meal is ready when they arrive at the cafeteria.
- **Discount Management**: Pre-ordered meals come with a discount that is automatically applied when the employee places their order through the app.
- System Integration: Our development team has integrated the app with the local point-of-sale system, enabling instant meal check-in and payment.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The integration also ensures that workers and cafeteria staff have real-time access to the status of orders, ensuring smooth service and faster transactions.

This integration has improved **efficiency** in the cafeteria, reduced waiting times and provided cost savings to employees through discounted pre-ordering.
