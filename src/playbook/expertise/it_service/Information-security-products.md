# Information security in custom digital product development: What you need to know

When developing custom digital products, **security** often takes a back seat to **visual appeal** and **user experience**. While the design and functionality of a product are critical to delivering value to the customer, **data security** is equally, if not more, important. Many companies overlook security during development, only to realise the consequences after a security breach or data leak.

In this article, we discuss why **information security** should be a top priority when developing custom products, and outline the key areas developers should focus on to ensure the security and integrity of data.

## Key areas to focus on for information security

### 1. Secure infrastructure

Choosing the right **infrastructure** to host your digital product is the foundation of good security. Whether your product is hosted in the cloud or on-premises, developers need to ensure that the infrastructure meets industry security standards. Factors to consider include:

- **Secure hosting environments** (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)
- Regular **security audits** and **vulnerability scans**.
- Proper **firewall configurations** and **network segmentation**.

### 2. Data security in databases

One of the most vulnerable areas of any digital product is the **database**. Sensitive information such as customer data, personal identification details and payment information is often stored here. To prevent unauthorised access or data leakage, it's important to

- Implement **strong encryption** for both **data at rest** and **data in transit**.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data.
- Audit database access regularly and **log all database queries**.

Example of implementing **encryption** in **C#**:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

public class DataEncryption
{
    public static string EncryptData(string data, string key)
    {
        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create())
        {
            aesAlg.Key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(key)
            aesAlg.GenerateIV();
            ICryptoTransform encryptor = aesAlg.CreateEncryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);

            byte[] encrypted = encryptor.TransformFinalBlock(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data), 0, data.Length)

            return Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted)
        }
    }
}
```

This C# example demonstrates how to encrypt sensitive data before storing it in a database. It emphasises the need to encrypt data at every stage of data handling.

# 3. Password management and data transfer

One of the most critical areas of security is the handling of passwords and data transmission. Developers should implement secure methods for storing, transmitting and encrypting passwords. Some best practices include

- Use strong hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2 to store passwords.
- Never store passwords in clear text.
- Ensure HTTPS encryption for all data exchange between client and server.

When developing mobile applications, it's also important to use end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data in transit. Developers should also consider using OAuth2 for authentication to avoid exposing user credentials.

## 4. Encryption in mobile applications

Mobile applications often involve the transmission and storage of sensitive user data. Ensuring that this data is securely encrypted is critical to preventing unauthorised access. Mobile data security best practices include

Encrypting local storage in the application (e.g. user tokens, sensitive user information).
Implementing certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
Ensure secure key management in the mobile environment.
For example, encrypting sensitive user information stored in mobile applications reduces the risk of attack even if the physical device is compromised.

## 5. Business processes: Handling sensitive data

Security doesn't end with technology; business processes need to be secure too. Developers should work with business leaders to ensure that processes for handling sensitive data, such as password storage and data sharing, comply with industry regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. Key areas to consider include

Policies for storing and sharing passwords between employees.
Ensuring secure access control for third-party services that interact with the product.
Regular security training for employees who handle sensitive information.
Why security matters in custom product development
In the age of data breaches and cyber-attacks, the cost of a security failure can be devastating. Customers trust developers not only to build a functional product, but also to ensure that it is secure by design. Prioritising security in the development phase can prevent costly problems down the line and build long-term trust with your customers.
