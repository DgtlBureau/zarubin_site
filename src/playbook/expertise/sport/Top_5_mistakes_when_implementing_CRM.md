Simply implementing a CRM system into a sports club's operations will not solve all existing problems on its own. A comprehensive approach is needed to ensure that all services interact correctly with each other and that business processes run smoothly. Let's take a look at the problems clubs encounter when working with CRM, and highlight the top 5 mistakes that management can make when interacting with the system.

## Global issues

The most important thing to understand is that CRM is not a panacea, and it does not solve the problem of ticket sales on its own. It is a tool that needs to be integrated and implemented into the business process. Any software is implemented in three stages: training, system installation, and integration—both technical and business processes.  

The lack of personnel also has a negative impact on the situation. For example, a club installed a CRM and put the person who had previously been responsible for websites and sales in charge of it. He does not understand what to do, how, why, and for whom. There are fewer human resources, more problems, and ultimately no results. 

The third problem is a lack of budget. It is hard to believe that clubs that receive at least a billion rubles annually from sponsors cannot allocate 150,000 rubles for CRM. This raises another important point: when the money is not yours, it doesn't matter where you spend it. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether you install a “dummy” for 60,000 rubles or a good working system that will cost more. 

The fourth problem is low staff qualifications. When a club has no money, it turns out that either no new staff are hired at all (point two), or unqualified people are hired. Two people were hired instead of one, but they did not become more professional, and nothing changed in the business processes. 

The fifth point is the most unexpected—people's reactions. As soon as you start doing something, there is outrage, and there is no support where it is really needed. For example, you create a new team in the region, and you are required to promote children's sports. And what does it even mean to promote children's sports? No one can say.

## Top 5 major mistakes

The first mistake is essentially related to the first problem mentioned above—there are no established business processes that could be integrated with CRM. The second mistake is a lack of understanding of where to get data from and, accordingly, what the final normal product should look like. Unfortunately, this is not taught anywhere, so clubs often find a contractor and do whatever they say. 

The third mistake is supporting something that cannot be developed. The lack of quality management on the ground means that no one can make a strong decision to tear down the old system, invest money to implement something new, and forget about the past as if it were a bad dream. 

The fourth mistake is the clubs' excessive focus on achievements. It doesn't matter who won the Gagarin Cup! Develop a children's school, your own brand, social media, and do it from the bottom up. Ideally, VHL, MHL, and student league clubs should have half the number of fans who go to KHL games. But in the end, our stadiums are only full for KHL games, with about 200 people attending VHL games, and even fewer for student leagues — most often it's parents, friends, or just acquaintances. 

And lastly, there is no staff training. In America, employees undergo annual professional development, either online or offline. In Russia, this does not exist, despite the fact that a club is a large, complex structure that requires a great deal of knowledge and a highly developed staff.

## Results

Most mistakes in CRM integration stem from ignorance. For example, money is not allocated because it is unclear what it will be spent on, or a loyalty program is launched only on promotional codes. It is unheard of that after launching one thing, another is not immediately put into circulation. There should always be a big plan in mind, without which it is impossible to move forward. CRM does not solve these problems, but at their root lies one thing: management and managerial decisions.
