## The future of stadium technology: Trends to watch

### 1. Integration of 5G

By integrating 5G, stadiums will be able to deliver the high internet speeds and low latency that enable features such as live streaming and real-time replay across multiple cameras to be displayed on fans' devices. The Tokyo 2020 Olympics were able to take advantage of 5G networks to provide spectators with additional overlay features using AR, such as real-time stats and athlete information about events. This technology allows venues to meet the connectivity needs of tens of thousands of fans without disrupting communications and content distribution.

5G also supports the creation of IoT structures, including smart ticketing structures and sensors for crowd analysis. For example, fans in the Vodafone Business Lounge at the Borussia Dortmund stadium use IoT devices powered by 5G to zone fans, reposition seats and improve security measures. It has high capacity and reliability, through which data is collected and likely analysed in real time, transforming stadium management.

### 2. Multi-Purpose Venues

Stadiums are no longer just A-ticket facilities. Multi-purpose stadiums are used to host sporting events, concerts, conferences and community activities. For example, the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta hosts NFL games, soccer matches and major music concerts. The fact that it has a retractable roof and retractable seating means that it is extremely versatile and can be used for many profitable purposes throughout the year, appealing to more than just sports fans.

The multi-purpose facilities of the twenty-first century include retail, dining and entertainment components. Finally, the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles integrates a new-age sports venue with shopping malls, restaurants, nightlife and housing. The model below reinvigorates the traditional stadium into an active venue where people come to enjoy a variety of activities in addition to events.

### 3. AI and Big Data

Better analytics can predict trends, maximise resources and improve marketing activities. AI and big data are transforming stadium management, providing recommendations for an enjoyable fan experience and increasing the efficiency of the facility. These are the technologies that Bright Byte presents.

Bright Byte uses AI-powered data analytics to help stadium operators make smarter decisions and movement patterns to identify trends and optimise operations in real time. For example, during an event, Bright Byte can predict which concession stands will experience high demand and suggest staff reallocation to minimise wait times.

## Action Plan: Bringing digital transformation to your venue

Here’s how businesses can embrace the digitisation of stadium services:

1. **Assess Needs**: Identify areas where technology can improve operations or fan experience.
2. **Collaborate with Experts**: Work with tech providers to implement scalable solutions.
3. **Invest in Training**: Equip staff to manage and utilize new systems effectively.
4. **Monitor Success**: Use analytics to refine offerings continuously.
