### Why loyalty programmes work

- **Increased fan engagement**: Fans interact more deeply with their favourite teams through app challenges, personalised rewards, and unique offers.
- **Increased revenue**: Loyalty apps drive merchandise sales and ticket purchases while monetising through partnerships.
- **Valuable data insights**: By identifying how fans engage with the application at different levels, such as product purchase and familiar media content, teams can improve their strategies.

For example, the Montreal Canadiens' _Club 1909_ incentivises fans for various actions and events, including attendance, merchandise purchases, and social media activity. Their prizes are frequencies that can be exchanged for points, meaningful experiences, and other merchandise.

### Key features of mobile loyalty apps for NHL fans

#### Points-based systems: Trying to build active two-way communication with fans

Points-based schemes are common in sports club loyalty programmes and they're relatively easy to implement. Points are earned through people's activities, such as attending a match, buying football related products or completing challenges in the app. These systems increase the methods by which individuals engage with the application multiple times and help build closer relationships with teams.

**How it works**:

1. **Earn points**: This includes playing games or taking part in team-sponsored quizzes, etc..
2. **Redeem rewards**: Points can be redeemed for privileges such as autographed merchandise, special offers and VVIP treatment.

For example, the Toronto Maple Leafs have an app that gives fans reward points that can be redeemed for dollar discounts on tickets, tours, etc.

#### Exclusive content and VIP experiences

Fans value a deeper connection with their teams, and the NHL mobile apps deliver through exclusive content and VIP offerings. These features make fans feel like part of an inner circle.

- **Behind-the-scenes access**: Practice videos, locker room interviews and pre-game rituals are shared exclusively on the apps.
- **Real-time updates**: Live updates and news on a specific trade, injuries or any team related statement will keep fans engaged.  
  Fan Club benefits are as simple as player handshakes and photo opportunities, part of the line up ceremony or a seat in the press box for the best view of the game. Such enticing opportunities set the NHL's loyalty programmes apart and keep users coming back to the app.

## How technology is shaping NHL loyalty programmes

### Leveraging advanced features

Technological innovations have pushed mobile loyalty apps beyond simple rewards systems. Teams are now using advanced tools to enhance the fan experience:

- **Gamification**: Trivia challenges, score predictions, and mini-games encourage fan participation. For example, the Chicago Blackhawks app offers a prediction game where fans can guess the score and win rewards.
- **Blockchain Tokens**: Some teams are exploring blockchain to create digital collectibles that fans can earn, trade, or purchase.
- **Data Analytics**: Apps are analysing user behaviour to fine-tune rewards, ensuring fans receive personalised offers that resonate.
